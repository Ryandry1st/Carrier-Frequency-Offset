# Carrier-Frequency-Offset
Detailed code used for researching machine learning for carrier frequency offset

The main page is a colab journal which includes the process, training, and evaluation of many different models considered for carrier frequency offset estimation, aimed at 5G and 6G applications.

This is in progress, I will update as more information is publicly available.

Please contact and cite me if you wish to use the code herein.
